Image Reconstruction Using CNN and Comparing performance of different CNN architectures

_Note:- The file 'Architecture_Comparision (Deep Learning).pdf', contains the detailed explanations of different architectures and its effect on performance._
# It consists of Three Files  
 _1] Text Reconstruction.ipynb_  
 _2] Image Reconstruction.ipynb_  
Text Reconstruction.ipynb contains two parts.  
  Part 1 deals with using different networks and Auto-encoders on a set of hand written texts and reconstructingthe same.  
  Part 2 deals with using similar networks and Auto-encoders on a text distorted by noise and trying to reconstuct the orginal text.  
Image Reconstruction deals majorly with Reconstructing Noisy images to retrive a clear image.  
Our major aim was to create a network with minimum meansquared error.  

 _3] Third file is the combination of first two files._  
Architecture_Comparision (Deep Learning).pdf will explain its contents in detail.
